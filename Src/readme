### Steps to Compile and Run:

1. **Install NASM (if not already installed):**
   - Download NASM from the official website: [https://www.nasm.us/](https://www.nasm.us/).
   - Run the installer and follow the instructions.
   - Ensure NASM is added to your system's PATH.

     ```
     nasm -v
     ```
     You should see the version of NASM installed.

2. **Navigate to the [Src] directory:**

3. **Run the `compiler.bat` script to assemble and link the OS:**

6. **Run the OS using QEMU:**

### Notes:
- Ensure that `qemu-system-x86_64` is installed and added to your system's PATH.
- If you encounter any errors during compilation, check the `compiler.bat` script for missing dependencies or incorrect paths.
- Repeat steps 3â€“6 to recompile and test changes to the OS code.
